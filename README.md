- Which Stores has the highest revenue?
- Which line of business is thriving?
- Which Stores has a declining trend?

  ### Data Analysis
  To get the Transaction Category =IF(J2<=20,"Low",IF(J2<=50,"Medium","High"))

 ### Conclusion 
 ---
1.The Bottom five Stores by units sold shows a declining trend in Total Unit Sold. This highlights the need for the company to address any existing challenges such as market competitive or consumer behaviour at the affected stores which is having negative effect on the sales and come to a conclusion if there is still a need for business continuation in the affected Stores if no solutions afterward. The decline margin is more visible with the visualization

The top ten Stores by Revenue shows a thriving trend by Revenue generated within the period. The company can introduce incentives, bonus or promotion to the staffs of the Stores or discount when purchasing the product as an encouragement to do more. 

The Service Plan Line of Business shows a strong thriving trend above others. The company should try all within their means to keep the trend upward by focusing more on marketing strategies. This can be achieved by maintaining the product's quality/standard, customer engagement, seasonal promo and so on.
